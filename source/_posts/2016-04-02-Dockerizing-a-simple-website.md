### Introduction
If you do not know Docker, please have a look at their website and the numerous presentation of the basic concepts. To keep it short, Docker is a container management system, allowing to have small contained processes instead of virtualising systems, therefore reducing the overhead introduced in the virtualisation.

### Assumptions and definitions
For this tutorial, we will start with a fresh Ubuntu Server 14.04.1 installation on Digital Ocean, but you can follow the same steps with any similar Ubuntu server. Please comment if you see any major difference.
