# About the blog

Engineor LTD is a Scottish company providing high value added development services.
While we are only two persons, we try to spend as many time investigating new processes and technologies in order to provide the best services possible to our clients.

This blog, started close to our companie's second anniversary, relates some of our experiences that we would love to share with you in any possible way.
